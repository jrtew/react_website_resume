        <p>Hi, I'm Ross!</p>
        <p>I am a Software Engineer for <a href="https://www.togetherwork.com/" >Togetherwork</a> - 
        a company based out of Brooklyn, NY that provides group management and payment software 
        for groups and organizations in the United States and Canada.  I work on the payment 
        processing team where my main duties involve: maintaining our payment platform API, adding 
        new features to our front-end reporting application, and providing support to our team of 
        Business Analysts. </p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and our dogs, Walter and Trista. Some 
            of my other hobbies include: riding motorcycles, music and movies, making coffee for 
            my team at work, and enjoying a nice beer - I like stouts and IPAs.
