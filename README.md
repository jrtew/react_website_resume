## Ross Tew - React Website Resume

This website is my current side-project I have been working on as I refresh my React.js skills while taking Maximilian Schwarzmuller's React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) course on Udemy. This has been a fun way to brush up on my skills and create a site that has a little bit of info about myself, along with my resume.
